# Watershed Conditions

```{admonition} **Drought Status:** 
:class: attention
British Columbia, including the Lower Mainland basin, is experiencing significant seasonal drought this summer. More information on current drought conditions are provided in this resource, and can also be found in the [BC Drought Information Portal](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/drought-flooding-dikes-dams/drought-information).

This section summarizes recent weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas. It has been an exceptionally warm and dry spring and summer. This has led to extreme drought conditions, elevated wildfire risk, and regional water supply concerns. Please refer to the [](outlook.md) section for information on how these key parameters are expected to change in the coming weeks and months.
