# Water Services Seasonal Climate Outlook

This resource provides a summary of current and recent weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas. You will find high-level summaries in the [](watershed_conditions.md), [](global.md), and the [](outlook_summary.md) sections. This is a good place to start. Detailed local conditions are laid out in the [](air-temp.ipynb) and [](snowpack.ipynb) sections. You will also find a more detailed medium-to-long range [](outlook.md). 

The purpose of this book is to provide information for source water supply planning, and operational decision-making. It's also meant to raise awareness about climate change and local impacts from extreme weather events. 

This book will be updated monthly during the first week of each month.

This resource is created by Peter Marshall (Contact: [Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org](mailto:Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org)). Weather and climate data are primarily from a network of hydro-meteorological stations within the water supply areas. Check out the [](overview_map.ipynb) to see the location of some of these monitoring stations. Additional data and plots from federal and provincial government agencies, research institutes, and US climate services are also included. Check out the [](links.md) section for more information about any of these products, or for the most current conditions.
