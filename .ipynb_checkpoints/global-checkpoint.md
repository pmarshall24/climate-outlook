```{admonition} **Off the Charts Heat** 
:class: danger
July was the hottest month on Earth in over 100,000 years (and by a significant margin)! 
```

Many parts of the globe have experienced intense and prolonged heat waves in 2023. Globally, June was the [hottest ever](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-hottest-june-on-record) this year, and by a considerable margin. Moving into July, headlines were made when average global temperatures climbed into all-time record territory and stayed there all month. This July was the [hottest month ever on record](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/july-2023-set-be-hottest-month-record). 

The chart below shows the global average temperature from 1979 to present. The bold black line represents 2023, while the orange line highlights 2022. The previous global high temperature was set on August 14, 2016 (16.92 C).

Sea surface temperatures have also been in completely new territory this year. The chart below is absolutely shocking! This means there is significant heat (energy) at the surface of the ocean to interact with the atmosphere. As a result, we could see hotter average air temperatures and more intense storms in the coming months and years.

It's very hard to accurately predict the weather in the long range. Seasonal climate outlooks are designed to lay out probabilities of different patterns occurring (i.e. will it be warmer, colder, wetter, or drier than normal). One thing is certain though, and that is we **must expect the unexpected.** Weather this year has been alarming and there is no reason to believe these alarms bells will fade.
