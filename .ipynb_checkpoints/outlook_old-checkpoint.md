## Short Range Outlook

Let's start off looking at the forecast for the next week. Below you can see the EPSgram for West Vancouver. This product is composed of the Canadian and US ensemble forecast systems. We can focus primarily on the temperature and precipitation plots. The box and whiskers show us the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the maximum and minimum values. September starts off with a couple warm days, but it should cool considerably towards the tail end of the long weekend. It's unlikely we'll see significant precipitation during the first couple weeks of the month, but some light rain is possible.

## Temperature Outlooks

The maps below show the probabilities of above, below, or near-normal temperatures for the next 8-14 days, 1-month, and 3-months. This gives us a rough indication of average temperatures over these periods. The higher the likelihood, the more confidence in the forecast. The second week of September could see slightly below normal temperatures, but overall, near-normal temperatures are likely for the month on average. The 1-3 month outlooks continue to call for warmer and drier than normal conditions.  

### 8-14 day outlook 
**Issued on August 31.** Temperatures over the next couple weeks may be slightly below-normal for the BC south coast.

### 1-3 month temperature and precipitation outlooks 

**Issued on August 31.** The 3-month temperature and precipitation outlooks are essentially unchanged from previous forecast. Warm and dry conditions are favoured for the BC south coast for the Sep-Oct-Nov period. There is a 70-80% probability of above normal temperatures, and ~10% chance of below normal temperatures for this period.

## Summary

**Continued drought conditions are likely.** September may be relatively cool compared to the past few months, but overall, average temperatures may still be near normal.  Forecast skill for precipitation is very low beyond 1 week, but at this point probabilistic outlooks show drier than normal conditions for the next few months.
