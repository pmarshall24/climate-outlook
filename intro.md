This webpage is a supplement to the annual *Watershed Climate Summary* report. It provides a series of plots, maps, and images summarizing the weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas in 2024. This is your opportunity to dig deeper into the data.

This resource is created by Peter Marshall (Contact: [Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org](mailto:Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org)). Weather and climate data are primarily from a network of hydro-meteorological stations within the water supply areas. Check out the [](overview_map.ipynb) to see the location of some of these monitoring stations. Additional data and plots from federal and provincial government agencies, research institutes, and US climate services are also included. Check out the [](links.md) section for more information about any of these products, or for the most current conditions.
