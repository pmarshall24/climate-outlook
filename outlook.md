# Climate Outlook

**Period:** August-September-October 2023

Let's start off looking at the deterministic forecast for the next 10 days. This is raw weather model data using the Canadian Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS). Focusing on the temperature and precipitation plots, we can see that it will likely be a warm and dry period.

The maps below show the probabilities of above, below, or near-normal temperatures for the 8-14 day period, 1 month, and three months. This gives us a rough indication of average temperatures over these periods. The higher the likelihood, the more confidence in the forecast.
