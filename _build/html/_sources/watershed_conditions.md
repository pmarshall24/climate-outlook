```{tab-item} Temperature
Temperatures have been warmer than normal for May (hottest May ever), June, and July. Oddly enough, the hottest day of the year (so far) was May 15th when temperatures reached 32.7 degrees in the lower Capilano Watershed.

```{tab-item} Precipitation
It has been an incredibly dry spring and early summer, and this is hot on the heels of an extended drought in 2022. Only 65 mm of rain has fallen since April 24. We've experienced 33-day and 25-day dry spells already this season.

```{tab-item} Snowpack
The snowpack was at ~100% of normal on May 1st, but rapidly melted under sweltering heat in May and early June. That being said, a healthy seasonal snowpack is what sets this year apart from the challenging 2015 season.

```{tab-item} River Inflows
Rapid snowmelt kept river levels above normal in May, but flow have now tapered off to historical low levels for July. River levels will continue to drop until there is significant and sustained precipitation.

```{tab-item} Wildfire
This is already a record-breaking year for wildfires in BC and Canada. In the watersheds, the number of days in **high or extreme** fire danger is already well above average. Fortunately, smoke has not drifted over Metro Vancouver yet this summer; however, this is certainly possible in the coming weeks with the number of very large fire burning throughout the province.
