Many parts of the globe have experienced intense and prolonged heat waves in 2023. Globally, June was the [hottest ever](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-hottest-june-on-record) this year, and by a considerable margin. Moving into July, headlines were made when average global temperatures climbed into all-time record territory, and stayed there for well over a week. The chart below shows the global average temperature from 1979 to present (bold black line). 2022 is represented by the orange line. The previous global high temperature was set on August 14, 2016 (16.92 C).

Sea surface temperatures have also been off the charts in 2023. The chart below is absolutely shocking! This means there is significant heat (energy) at the surface of the ocean to interact with the atmosphere. As a result, we could see hotter average air temperatures and more intense storms.

It's very hard to accurately predict the weather in the long range. Seasonal climate outlooks are designed to lay out probabilities of different patterns occurring (i.e. will it be warmer, colder, wetter, or drier than normal). One thing is certain though, and that is we must expect the unexpected.
