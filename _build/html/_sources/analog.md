# Analog Comparison

This section compares this year to other years with similar climate characteristics. For this period, the best analog year is 2009-2010. This year was used throughout the winter and spring, and proved to be a good comparison. La Niña conditions were present in 2008 and 2009, but shifted to El Niño by June 2009. This was a moderate El Niño event that lasted until April 2010. 

**Summer 2009**

This summer was marked by hot conditions in July, then near-normal temperatures for the remainder of the summer and into the fall. It was a busy provincial and local wildfire season ([Fire Stats](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/wildfire-history/wildfire-season-summary)). Record heat in late July, followed by lightning sparked multiple fires in areas surrounding the watersheds. Fall rains did come relatively early this year though. It was also a very wet fall season. 

Moving into the winter, mild temperatures kept snowpack levels below normal for the first half of the season. This was the year of the Vancouver Olympics, which was marked by poor North Shore snow conditions in February ([No Snow at Olympics Site](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/no-snow-at-olympic-site-leaves-vanoc-scrambling-1.918004)). The second half of the season was a very different story though. Temperatures cooled and the snowpack built to near-normal levels in the spring.

```{admonition} Analog Summary
As mentioned... expect the unexpected. Analog comparisons may not always be useful in climate outlooks.
If this year follows a similar pattern, we could see a shift to wetter conditions late this summer.
