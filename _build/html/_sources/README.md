# Watershed Climate Outlook

This book provides a summary of current and recent weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas. You will also find a 1-3 month climate outlook. It will be updated monthly during the first week of each month.

The purpose of this book is to provide information for source water supply planning, and operational decision-making. It's also meant to raise awareness about climate change and local impacts from extreme weather events. 

Weather and climate data are primarily from a network of hydro-meteorological stations within the water supply areas. Additional material from federal and provincial government agencies and climate resources has been added.
