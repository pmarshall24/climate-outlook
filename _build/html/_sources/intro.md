# Watershed Climate Outlook


This book provides a summary of current and recent weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas. You will find a high-level local conditions summary in the [](watershed_conditions.md) section, and a global overview in the [](global.md) section. This is a good place to start. Detailed local conditions are laid out in the [](air-temp.ipynb), [](water_supply.ipynb), and [](crossover.ipynb) sections. You will also find a medium-to-long range [](outlook.md). 

The purpose of this book is to provide information for source water supply planning, and operational decision-making. It's also meant to raise awareness about climate change and local impacts from extreme weather events. 

This book will be updated monthly during the first week of each month.
