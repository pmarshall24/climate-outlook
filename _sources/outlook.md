## Short Range Outlook

Let's start off looking at the forecast for the next week. Below you can see the EPSgram for West Vancouver. This product is composed of the Canadian and US ensemble forecast systems. We can focus primarily on the temperature and precipitation plots. The box and whiskers show us the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the maximum and minimum values. The general trend shows continued warm temperatures and very low probabilities of any precipitation over the next two weeks. Our warm and dry summer continues!

## Temperature Outlooks

The maps below show the probabilities of above, below, or near-normal temperatures for the next 8-14 days, 1-month, and 3-months. This gives us a rough indication of average temperatures over these periods. The higher the likelihood, the more confidence in the forecast. In general, we can expect warmer than average conditions for all of these periods. 

### 8-14 day outlook 
**Issued on July 31.** Temperatures over the next couple weeks should be slightly warmer than normal for this time of year.

## Summary

All signs point to above average temperatures for the remainder of the summer and start of the fall. We're not expecting any real precipitation over the next two weeks. Forecast skill for precipitation is very low beyond 1 week, but at this point probabilistic outlooks show drier than normal conditions for the next few months. **Continued and worsening drought conditions are likely.**
