# Analog Comparison

This section compares this year to other years with similar climate characteristics. For this period, the best analog year is still **2009-2010**. This year was used throughout the winter and spring, and proved to be a good comparison. La Niña conditions were present in 2008 and 2009, but shifted to El Niño by June 2009. This was a moderate El Niño event that lasted until April 2010. 

**Fall 2009**

Fall rains came relatively early in 2009 and it was generally a wet fall season overall. November saw 158% of normal precipitation, and December was much drier and cooler with only 56% of normal precipitation and over 1 degree cooler than normal. El Nino really kicked into gear in January. Precipitation was near-normal this month, but average temperatures were almost 3 degrees warmer than normal. Overall, the BC south coast saw conditions that were slightly drier and cooler than normal during this period, but it was very different from month to month.

Moving into the winter, mild temperatures kept snowpack levels below normal for the first half of the season. This was the year of the Vancouver Olympics, which was marked by poor North Shore snow conditions in February ([No Snow at Olympics Site](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/no-snow-at-olympic-site-leaves-vanoc-scrambling-1.918004)). The second half of the season was a very different story though. Temperatures cooled and the snowpack built to near-normal levels in the spring.

**Other Potential Analog Years**
1957-58 and 1972-73 are additional analog years that could be used for this outlook. These years saw ENSO conditions shift from La Niña to El Niño, and both experienced moderate to strong El Niño events during the winter. The PDO was also in a cool, or negative, phase during this time. 

The fall months for both of these years saw *below* normal precipitation. Temperatures were slightly warmer than normal in 1957, but were cooler than normal in 1972. The winter snowpack was near normal in 1958, but was around 75-80% of normal in 1973. These snowpack comparisons may be of little value given that they were 50 and 65 years ago and our climate has changed considerably since then. 

```{admonition} Analog Summary
As mentioned, we must expect the unexpected. Analog comparisons may be less useful in climate outlooks in the future.
If this year follows a similar pattern to 2009-2010, then we could see a wet fall and slow-to-develop winter.
