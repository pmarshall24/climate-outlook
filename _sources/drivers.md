# Climate Drivers

**Period:** August-September-October 2023

## El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

```{admonition} ENSO Status
An **El Niño Advisory** is in effect
```

La Niña faded to neutral conditions this spring, with El Niño being officially declared at the beginning of June. There is a greater than 90% chance that El Niño will continue through the Northern Hemisphere winter. This will most likely be a moderate El Niño, but there is a chance it could be a very strong event. The last El Niño event was in 2018-2019.

What does this mean for Western Canada and the BC South Coast? First off, the warm and cool phases of ENSO (El Niño and La Niña) are related to sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean (specifically the Niño 3.4 region). When the waters in this region become warmer than normal it causes a shift in atmospheric circulation and impacts weather around the world. Globally, the warmest years on record are typically El Niño years. This is also true for the BC South Coast (2015-16). The effects of El Niño are felt more during the winter and spring months. Warmer temperatures typically mean less snow (or a higher snowline elevation) on our relatively low North Shore Mountains. This can have significant impacts on source water supply as we move into the drier season. 

## Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a long-term ocean fluctuation of the northern Pacific Ocean. The PDO waxes and wanes approximately every 20 to 30 years. We've been in a PDO cool phase since 1998-99, with the exception of a brief shift to the warm phase in 2014-2016. The PDO has been strongly negative (cool) since 2020. The PDO has a similar impact to ENSO on weather in western Canada, but over a much longer period. Temperatures are typically cooler during the PDO cool phase, and warmer during the PDO warm phase. During the last warm phase (1976-1998) the North Shore snowpack was regularly below normal. Unlike ENSO, it's not possible to forecast the PDO regime shift. 

The diagram below shows what sea surface temperature anomalies look like during PDO warm and cool phases. The map of current conditions (below) mirror the cool phase diagram on the left.

The map below shows weekly sea surface temperature anomalies. Negative PDO conditions are apparent in the North Pacific, and El Niño in the tropical Pacific (warm waters).
