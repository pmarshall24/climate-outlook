The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) have been identified as the two most influential ocean–atmosphere teleconnections on the hydro-climatology of western Canada. ENSO and the PDO can both influence temperatures, snowpack, streamflow, and precipitation on British Columbia’s south coast. The oscillating warming and cooling pattern of ENSO happens over a period of 1-3 years, whereas the PDO is longer lasting and shifts in periods of 2-3 decades. Below we can see current and forecasted ENSO conditions. It's not possible to forecast PDO conditions, but we have been in a predominantly cool PDO phase for 25 years now.  

## El Niño - Southern Oscillation 
```{admonition} ENSO Status
An **El Niño Advisory** is in effect

La Niña faded to neutral conditions this spring, with El Niño being officially declared at the beginning of June. El Niño certain (100% probability) this fall and early winter, and is expected to continue into the spring. This will most likely be a moderate to strong El Niño event. The last El Niño event was in 2018-2019, and the last strong event occurred in 2014-2016.

What does this mean for Western Canada and the BC South Coast? First off, the warm and cool phases of ENSO (El Niño and La Niña) are related to sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean (specifically the Niño 3.4 region). When the waters in this region become warmer than normal it causes a shift in atmospheric circulation and impacts weather around the world. Globally, the warmest years on record are typically El Niño years. This is also true for the BC South Coast (E.g. 2015-16). The effects of El Niño are felt more during the winter and spring months. Warmer temperatures typically mean less snow (a higher snowline elevation) on our relatively low North Shore Mountains. The 2015 winter season was marked by a historic snow drought. This can have significant impacts on source water supply as we move into the drier season. 

## Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
The PDO has been predominantly negative (cool) since 1998, and strongly negative since 2020. The PDO has a similar impact to ENSO on weather in western Canada, but over a much longer period. Temperatures are typically cooler during the PDO cool phase, and warmer during the PDO warm phase. During the last warm phase (1976-1998) the North Shore snowpack was regularly below normal. Unlike ENSO, it's not possible to forecast the PDO regime shift. 

The diagram below shows what sea surface temperature anomalies look like during PDO warm and cool phases. The map of current conditions (below) mirror the cool phase diagram on the left.

PDO cool and warm phases

The map below shows monthly average sea surface temperature anomalies in September. Negative PDO conditions are apparent in the North Pacific (warm waters off the west coast of N. America), and El Niño is evident in the tropical Pacific (warm waters off the coast of Peru). Globally, sea surface temperatures have been record-breaking for most of 2023. Temperatures have actually been in uncharted territory!
